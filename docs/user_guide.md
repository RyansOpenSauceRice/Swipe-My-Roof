# Swipe-My-Roof User Guide for OSM Volunteers

Welcome to Swipe-My-Roof! This guide will help you get started with contributing roof color data to OpenStreetMap using our easy-to-use mobile application.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the App**: Install Swipe-My-Roof from F-Droid or directly from our GitHub releases page.
2. **Create an Account**: Sign in with your OpenStreetMap account credentials.
3. **Choose Your Area**: Select a geographic area you're familiar with to start validating roof colors.

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Screen

The main screen shows you a satellite image of a building with a suggested roof color. You'll see:

- **Building Outline**: Highlighted in blue
- **Suggested Color**: The AI's best guess for the roof color
- **Confidence Indicator**: Shows how confident the AI is about its suggestion
- **Action Buttons**: Accept, Reject, or Modify

### Confidence Indicators

We use a clear visual system to show how confident the AI is about each suggestion:

- **Very Low** (Red): The AI is very uncertain - please verify carefully
- **Low** (Orange): The AI is uncertain - please verify
- **Medium** (Yellow): The AI is moderately confident
- **High** (Light Green): The AI is confident
- **Very High** (Green): The AI is very confident

When confidence is low, you'll also see warning messages explaining why (shadows, poor image quality, etc.).

## How to Contribute

### Practice Mode

When you first start, we recommend using Practice Mode:

1. Tap "Start Practice Session" from the main menu
2. Review the building and suggested roof color
3. Swipe right to accept, left to reject, or tap the edit button to modify
4. You'll receive feedback on your decisions
5. No changes are uploaded to OSM in this mode

### Real Mode

Once you're comfortable with the interface:

1. Tap "Start Real Session" from the main menu
2. Review buildings and make decisions as in Practice Mode
3. Your decisions are saved locally
4. Review your changes in the "Upload Queue" before they're sent to OSM
5. Tap "Upload" when you're ready to contribute your changes

### Tips for Accurate Contributions

- **Use Local Knowledge**: If you're familiar with the area, trust your knowledge
- **Pay Attention to Confidence**: Be extra careful with low-confidence suggestions
- **Check for Shadows**: Shadows can make roofs appear darker than they are
- **Consider the Time of Day**: Morning/evening images may have different lighting
- **When in Doubt, Skip**: It's better to skip than to submit incorrect data

## Managing Your Contributions

- **View Upload Queue**: See all your pending changes before they're uploaded
- **Edit Before Upload**: You can modify any pending change before uploading
- **Remove from Queue**: Delete any changes you're unsure about
- **Batch Upload**: Upload multiple changes at once when you have a good connection

## Settings

Customize your experience in the Settings menu:

- **Practice Mode**: Toggle training mode on/off
- **Notification Preferences**: Control when you receive notifications
- **Data Usage**: Manage how much data the app uses
